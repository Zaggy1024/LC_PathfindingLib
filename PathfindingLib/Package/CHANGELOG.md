## Version 2.2.0
- Added patches to prevent auto-updating OffMeshLinks and NavMeshLinks from causing stutter stepping when they move.
- Made waiting for/in elevators not count towards the time spent walking towards a node in the smart search routine.

## Version 2.1.3
- Corrected the search area when mapping path origins and destinations onto the navmesh to match `NavMesh.CalculatePath()`.

## Version 2.1.2
- Fixed a crash with off-mesh links that are missing one or both endpoint transforms. This was causing a crash upon landing on Black Mesa.

## Version 2.1.1
- Re-release of 2.1.0 without debug functionality.

## Version 2.1.0
- Fixed a crash on Bozoros caused by moving NavMeshLinks.

## Version 2.0.0
- Added the `IElevator.IsInsideElevator(Vector3)` to determine if a point is inside the physical bounds of the elevator, which is required to be implemented for all registered elevators.
- Added the `SmartPathDestination.CanActivateDestination(Vector3)` method which determines whether an agent at that position can activate/use the destination. This is intended to prevent agents from pressing the button to send an elevator to a floor without being inside first, preventing AI from getting stuck repeatedly hitting elevator buttons.
- Allowed users of the `SmartRoaming` API to customize the distance that an agent is allowed to spend navigating to a node.

## Version 1.0.1
- Fixed errors that could occur if a `SmartPathTask` was allowed to be garbage collected instead of being `Dispose()`d.

## Version 1.0.0
- New APIs:
    - `SmartPathfinding`: A static class with methods to register smart agents, elevators, and teleporters for the smart pathfinding system.
    - `IElevator`: An interface that can be implemented to allow enemies to navigate through them if they use `SmartPathTask`.
    - `SmartPathTask`: A class to calculate paths to multiple destinations either directly or through entrance teleports and elevators.
    - `SmartRoaming`: A static class that reimplements the vanilla AI search routine using `SmartPathTask` to allow enemies that choose to use it to roam through elevators.
- Wiki pages will be added to the GitHub for usage instructions later!

## Version 0.1.1
- Fixed an issue that would cause partial paths passed to `NavMeshQueryUtils.FindStraightPath` to result in a final corner at the destination.
- Changed the new overloads of `NavMeshQueryUtils.FindStraightPath` to use `Vector3` instead of `float3`, as the Unity runtime assumes the memory layout matches `Vector3` internally.

## Version 0.1.0
- Made `NavMeshQueryUtils.FindStraightPath` call through to the Unity runtime instead of reimplementing the algorithm. The results should now match the output from `NavMeshPath.corners` perfectly.
- Deprecated the original overload of `NavMeshQueryUtils.FindStraightPath` in favor of one that requires less allocations to match the native Unity function's signature.

## Version 0.0.14
- Fixed a small leak of single-element arrays in `FindPathJob`.

## Version 0.0.13
- Reduced allocations by deprecating the reference-type `NavMeshReadLocker` in favor of a new value-type version in the `Utilities` namespace.

## Version 0.0.12
- Added some more flexible safeties to `NavMeshLock` to help avoid deadlocks.

## Version 0.0.11
- Reverted unreliable `NavMeshLock` safeties that were causing exceptions when apparently taking read locks on the main thread.

## Version 0.0.10
- Fixed pathfinding jobs not functioning properly in release builds.

## Version 0.0.9
- Added some extra checks to help ensure `NavMeshLock` that is used safely.
- Made `TogglableProfilerAuto` methods public.

## Version 0.0.8
- Fixed an issue where `FindPathJob` was not taking the read lock at the start of the job, but would later take the lock without releasing it, which could result in deadlocks.

## Version 0.0.7
- Reduced blocking of the main thread by hooking into the Unity runtime to detect when carving obstacles will make changes to the navmesh.
- Changed documentation to recommend using `NavMeshQuery.UpdateFindPath()` with an iteration limit, and unlocking the navmesh read between calls.

## Version 0.0.6
- Prevented API users releasing null `PooledFindPathJob` back to the pool to avoid null error spam.

## Version 0.0.5
- Reverted an unintentional change to the plugin's GUID string.

## Version 0.0.4
- Made the plugin GUID public for convenient hard dependency setup.

## Version 0.0.3
- Renamed the Plugin class to PathfindingLibPlugin.

## Version 0.0.2
- Replaced the icon with a new placeholder that will totally not stay indefinitely...

## Version 0.0.1
Initial version. Public-facing API includes:
- `FindPathJob`: A simple job to find a valid path for an agent to traverse between a start and end position.
- `JobPools`: A static class providing pooled `FindPathJob` instances that can be reused by any API users.
- `NavMeshLock`: Provides methods to prevent crashes when running pathfinding off the main thread.
- `PathfindingJobSharedResources`: A static class that provides a `NativeArray<NavMeshQuery>` that can be passed to a job to access a thread-specific instance of `NavMeshQuery`.
- `AgentExtensions.GetAgentPathOrigin(this NavMeshAgent)`: Gets the position that paths originating from an agent should start from. This avoids pathing failure when crossing links.
- `Pathfinding.FindStraightPath(...)`: Gets a straight path from the result of a NavMeshQuery.
